## Getting Started
- ### Project introduction
> The visual disability evaluation system is a virtual reality based simulator that provides three daily life environments: supermarket shopping, stair climbing and street walking, which returns the testing result between the patients with glaucoma and healthy individuals.
- ### Hardware and software setup:
> #### HTC VIVE/VIVE Pro Headset/Oculus+ controller (Xbox All Series / PlayStation 4) hardware connection
> #### Steam & SteamVR ([HTC VIVE Setup Tutorial](https://support.steampowered.com/steamvr/HTC_Vive/)) + PlayStation4 controller driver ([DS4Windows](https://ryochan7.github.io/ds4windows-site/))
- ### Download the [release demo](), unzip and click on it.
> This is the demo of virtual supermarket scene, you will experience some situations of daily supermarket shopping, such as buying drinks, snacks, toys and so on.
- ### Data analysis
> Your testing result is stored in `AppPath/TestResult/Program/`. You can download and start this [post-processing system]() to generate a visual disability score with reference
to the Mahalanobis distance (like the image below)
